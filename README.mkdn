# ABOUT

Kaizendo is about creating collaboratively authored polyscopic documents.

The idea is a web service that allows the management and creation of texts
that have "_aspects_", each aspect conveying the same message but in a
different way. E.g. a textbook with chapters that have alternative texts
written for dyslectics, for fast readers and for "average" readers.

To write such a text is a difficult and time-consuming task, especially
when you take into account all the different combinations of aspects.
The Kaizendo project is about making this both feasible and as easy as
possible.
